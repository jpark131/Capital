As a college student, I want to track how much I spend on food, rent, tuition,
and books and see monthly trends in my spendings, so that I can graduate
debt-free.

As a user, I want a categories page, so I can see the breakdown of my current
monthly budget and spendings by category.

As a user, I want to be notified of upcoming bills and whenever I spend above 
a specified threshold, so I can remain within my monthly budget.
